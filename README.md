#Treadmill Insights Dashboard
#Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based dashboard that provides users with valuable insights into their treadmill usage. The system will analyze treadmill operation parameters, offering real-time feedback and historical data visualization. The project is divided into three milestones, each focusing on key aspects of the dashboard's functionality.

#Milestones

#Milestone 1: Design and Basic Functions
In this phase, we'll lay the foundation for the dashboard by designing the system architecture and implementing basic functions. These functions will take treadmill operation parameters as inputs and generate derived insights.

#Milestone 2: Real-Time Data Visualization
Building upon the basic functions, Milestone 2 introduces real-time data visualization. When provided with treadmill parameters, the system will initiate a timer and continuously output calculated insights in real time until the program is manually aborted.

#Milestone 3: GUI Development and Additional Features
The final milestone focuses on enhancing user experience. A graphical user interface (GUI) will be designed using Python, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the dashboard. Additionally, error-handling mechanisms will be implemented to ensure robust performance. The system will feature options for recording and visualizing historical data, as well as functionality to track walking steps and estimated calories burned.
